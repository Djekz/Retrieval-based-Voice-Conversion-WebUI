> Check out our [Demo Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pm4y1z7Gm/) here!



> The dataset for the pre-training model uses nearly 50 hours of high quality audio from the VCTK open source dataset.

> High quality licensed song datasets will be added to the training-set often for your use, without having to worry about copyright infringement.

> Please look forward to the pretrained base model of RVCv3, which has larger parameters, more training data, better results, unchanged inference speed, and requires less training data for training.

## Features:
+ Reduce tone leakage by replacing the source feature to training-set feature using top1 retrieval;
+ Easy + fast training, even on poor graphics cards;
+ Training with a small amounts of data (>=10min low noise speech recommended);
+ Model fusion to change timbres (using ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge);
+ Easy-to-use WebUI;
+ UVR5 model to quickly separate vocals and instruments;
+ High-pitch Voice Extraction Algorithm [InterSpeech2023-RMVPE](#Credits) to prevent a muted sound problem. Provides the best results (significantly) and is faster with lower resource consumption than Crepe_full;
+ AMD/Intel graphics cards acceleration supported;
+ Intel ARC graphics cards acceleration with IPEX supported.
